Reverse Engeneering Crackme.org challenges with my solutions and explanations. 

This repository was created out of my interest in the security field.

These challenges teach me new things and keep me interested and entertained.

Some of them may be very simple, but the main focus is to document what I learn and the problem resolutions.

In summary, these are crackme challenges. By reverse engineering these .exe files, we can manipulate the programs—whether it’s bypassing password requirements or generating valid key licenses.

Have fun because I certainly did!
